# OSINT-Recon



## Objective

To gather publicly available information to identify potential vulnerabilities and understand the technological footprint of the site


### Skills Learned

- Data Collection: Efficiently gathering publicly available information from various online sources.
- Analysis: Interpreting and correlating data to identify patterns, relationships, and potential threats.
- Threat Assessment: Evaluating the potential risks and vulnerabilities exposed through open-source information.
- Reporting: Compiling findings into comprehensive, clear, and actionable reports for stakeholders.
- Tool Utilization: Proficiency in using OSINT tools and platforms for advanced data mining and reconnaissance tasks.

### Tools Used

OSINT Tools:
- WHOIS Lookup:a query and response protocol that allows you to search and access information about the ownership and registration of an Internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address, or an autonomous system
- Recon-ng: a web reconnaissance framework with a modular approach to gather information
